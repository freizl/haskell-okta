# Haskell + Okta Hosted Login Example
This example shows you how to use Haskell to login to your application with an Okta Hosted Login page.  The login is achieved through the [authorization code flow](https://developer.okta.com/authentication-guide/implementing-authentication/auth-code), where the user is redirected to the Okta-Hosted login page.  After the user authenticates they are redirected back to the application with an access code that is then exchanged for an access token.
